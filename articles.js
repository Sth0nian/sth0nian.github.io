            "Honestly the funniest thing was I would have forgotten this had I never started running. Let me explain.",
            "On January 1st I had gone running with my partner and her brother. A fools errand for sure and especially for someone as out of shape as myself. They promised a 3km run only. To start the new year. It was almost 3km away from home that they turned around and 5km later I have never felt so out of condition in my entire life. I decided to start on another fools errand, I would run every day this month.",
            "But how? What would the structure be? I remember a wise nugget of wisdom the Data Architect on my team at work dropped on us: it takes 21 days to form a habit, 4 days to break it. I figured, if I get to 21 January the last 10 days would be easy. the first week was hell. The second week worse. The third week slightly less work. Here you would be expecting an \"and suddenly it was all better!\". Alas, the fourth week went back to being hard again. However I did notice that somewhere along the way I stopped having that conversation with myself before a run that usually went like this:",
            "King : OK! Run time Inner-voice King : But why? You hate running King : That's true... Inner-voice King : How about an early night? King : Oh that sounds not a bad idea actually Inner-voice : Yesss... :devil:",
            "On February 1st, I thought well one more month and one more km per day.",
            "6 months later and I have so far added one more km per day and am now at 8km per day. I don't know if it got easier on the actual run, but it has become very much a habit, im no longer out of breath, find that the incremental kilometer per month extra is hardly noticeable and generally that (and corroborated with a seemingly arbitrary metric from strava) I feel a fair bit fitter.",
            "Working with Data and connections between systems I decided to create a small dashboard, automate it and have it hosted [here](https://sth0nian.github.io/x-km-per-day/) with code hosted [here](https://github.com/Sth0nian/x-km-per-day). Then I stumbled on this fun \"blog\" and decided to write it here.",

            "Today I had the idea to set myself a task to complete before the last day of my sabbatical. I have GCP access, AWS trial and can get an Azure one too. I will write a terraform module that will deploy to all three solutions, run some stress testing (perhaps spawning 1000 chickens) and then logging back the numbers / errors to a single file (including all the names of the chickens and which ones had problems).",
            "I want to do it in Terraform on Gitlab.com and hopefully it will require that I write some golang upskilling to create my own terraform provider and get it to perform specific functions like configuration changes to the server resources (backing up, turning off vm, imaging, creating larger container / vm, restoring vm, testing vm and destroying old vm), changing game mode on a running server (executing vm- / container-level commands on an existing container that doesnt require a rebuild) and pulloing stats out of a running instance to create dashboards.",

            "For the longest time, I have found myself wanting to write. What exactly it is that spurred this on I cannot say, but the truth of the matter is that it was always somewhat stuck in the back of my mind. A few people closer to me know that I started a novel during a period of time where I had to travel a lot for work and had extended amounts of time on airplanes and sat on the floor of airport lounges. While shuffling through those hubs of overpriced goods, gaggles of pilots and flight-attendents and the general bustle of people lining up for food they would never normally eat elsewhere, inspiration hit and I just started writing. There was no identifiable motivation, I had no guidance and only a vague idea of what I wanted to write.",
            "That was 6 years ago and the 5 chapters and 15,000 words later, the novel still remains unfinished and waiting for me to return. Today, of all days, two thirds of my way through a 3 month sabbatical, that same feeling hit. Opening my laptop for no real reason I opened up my editor and started writing this. Also, I wrote this. For no real reason. I am scared that this random bit of inspiration will leave me again so I am putting it online, setting a daily reminder for myself to write something (really anything) and just getting on with it.",
            "Hopefully some form of objective to this writing presents itself on this journey (though perhaps \"clueless wanderings\" is more apt)."
