So much for writing every day.

Today I had the idea to set myself a task to complete before the last day of my sabbatical. I have GCP access, AWS trial and can get an Azure one too. I will write a terraform module that will deploy to all three solutions, run some stress testing (perhaps spawning 1000 chickens) and then logging back the numbers / errors to a single file (including all the names of the chickens and which ones had problems).

I want to do it in Terraform on Gitlab.com and hopefully it will require that I write some golang upskilling to create my own terraform provider and get it to perform specific functions like configuration changes to the server resources (backing up, turning off vm, imaging, creating larger container / vm, restoring vm, testing vm and destroying old vm), changing game mode on a running server (executing vm- / container-level commands on an existing container that doesnt require a rebuild) and pulloing stats out of a running instance to create dashboards.

It's definitely going to have chickens in it.
