        <b>HI!</b><br /><br />My name is <b>King Toi Ho</b
        ><br /><br />👨🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💼👶🏼👱🏻<br />I am 38 years old, live in Hilversum (NL), am
        a father of two, partner of one and owner of two cats.<br /><br />🧑‍🍳☕⚽🪴<br />I
        am an amateur cook, barista, footballer and gardener, though sometimes I
        like to think of myself as a self-proclaimed coffee-snob when I pull the
        perfect shot of espresso.<br /><br />🚌🇳🇱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🎓<br />I spent my formative
        years living between The Netherlands and England, where my educational
        journey took me from completing the International Baccalaureate in
        Hilversum to studying Law in Westminster, London. I then decided to
        shift my focus to Sociology at UCR in Middelburg, before pursuing a
        degree in Computer Games Development in Southampton. Finally, I
        completed my studies with a degree in Software Engineering at the VU in
        Amsterdam.<br /><br />🌍☮️✌️💻<br />Followin my studies I went to work
        on my own projects and was quickly recruited by Greenpeace International
        where I worked in IT Support. Soon after I became team lead then moved
        over to the SRE team where I was also the scrum master but my core
        specialty was in GCP Cloud infrastructure and IaC DevOps. After this
        challenge I moved to the Data Platform team as Lead Engineer and IaC
        Specialist (on top of Scum Master duties).
